                      reading this Glossary, you are probably registered for a Computing Science degree - for example BSc
                      (Hons) Software Engineering. Breaking this down, the Programme you are on is BSc (Hons) - this is a type
                      of degree - others in the University are MSci, MA, MEng, PhD and so on; the Plan that you are on is
                      Software Engineering. So the plan is akin to the topic or subject area of your degree, and the programme
                      relates to the level at which you are studying that topic. (Folk often informally use "Course of Study"
                      to mean a combination of their Programme and Plan.)</div>

                      that is expected on that course. Each single credit represents 10 learning hours, so if you are studying
                      for a 10 credit course, you should expect to spend around 100 hours on the course - made up of lectures,
                      labs, tutorials and your own study time. The formal contact time of lectures, labs and tutorials will
                      usually only be 20-40% of this total time. You typically must take 120 credits of courses each year.
